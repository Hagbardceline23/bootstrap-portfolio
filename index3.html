        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Robert Prince and I"m a web developer. My interest in software developement is not just limited to my
          career path, I also enjoy showcasing unique content for personal projects on the web. And, in addition to the pragmatic
          side of web development, I'm interested in the culture associated with the software community - especially the
          movement known as "self-hacking". There are interesting parallels between programming machine software and meta-prgramming
          one's own neural software; meta-programming is the psychology of self-actualization.</p>
        <p>In the portfolio section, I have utilized stunning visual imagery to captivate the imagination of the user. Alex
          Grey's depiction of hyperbolic geomentry is included in the portfolio. Also included is a web project featuring
          the deployment of cutting-edge, laser/light technology at a recent live music show in New York City. Another portfolio
          project is about Neurobics. Neurobics is a modern technology of brain science that encourages neuro-plasticity.</p>
